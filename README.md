# modal_queue

Our server sends Modal Events, (modal events are of the form described below).

```yml
ModalEvent
    id: string
    title: string
    subtitle: string
    action:
        share: text
        deeplink: uri
```

This project shows how to queue this modals, such that the UI can control when and when not Modal Events are handled, and acknowledging that event has been handled.

### Use Case

While working on [Achieve App](https://theachieveproject.com/), we implemented Server Side Modal Events.

- We use this to prompt user of Achievements Unlocked by their payments.
  eg: User makes payment of Ghc1000.00, an achievement or a Combo-Equivalend could be unlocked.

- We wanted to isolate the business logic behind the Achievements from the Client.

  #### Client Side

  - Client receives a silent push notification that triggers a call to fetch in-app modals.

  - We load this modals into memory and queue in a smooth way that does not interrupt user navigation in the app.

    eg: We didn't want to interrupt user while in the process of making a deposit or withdrawal.

### Motivation

- The Idea is to make the `View` handle attaching & detaching Modal Event Listeners. Remember MVP pattern in Android? yeah, something similar.

- The `ModalProvider` should only care about Listeners being registered and relaying the events sequentially through them.

- The `View` has to acknowledge receipt of the event so we can remove it from the in-memory queue.

#### My Takes

I was able to build a Widget LifeCycle Callback that exposes an `OnResume` & `OnPaused`. I can now use this to re-attach and detach the `ModalListener` instead of the `DoWhile` loop.

The `Widget LifeCycle Callback` relies heavily on the Route Names, it will not work if you're tracking onResume and onPaused on a page that doesn't register a `name` in it's `Route Settings`.
It compares the `current` and `previous` route so it can determine if page needed resume or pause callback.

> This doesn't require changing too many stuffs around and that's the goal. Also, it works fine in my current setup.

Let me know if you have any issues.
